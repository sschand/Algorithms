    <!-- Big O Notation:
    In this version of the Fibonacci Sequence, every time the function is called it saves the computed sequence in an array. So the next time the function is called, it first checks to see if the length requested is less than the computed sequence length. If so, the subarray with the requested length is printed. Otherwise, the missing sequence in the array are calculated and populated recursively.

    As previous computations are saved in memory, this function will only compute what hasn't already been computed which will save time and memory.


    function fib(num, arr){
        if(arr.length == 0){                                            >>> O(1)
            arr.push(0);                                                >>> O(1)

            // for case if length requested is 1
            if(num == 1){
                return arr;
            }

            arr.push(1);                                                >>> O(1)
            // for case if length requested is 2
            if(num == 2){
                return arr;
            }
        }

        // for cases length requested is greater than 2, populate sequence array recursively and return array
        if(num > arr.length){                                           >>> O(1)
            var current = arr[arr.length-2] + arr[arr.length-1];        >>> O(1)
            arr.push(current);                                          >>> O(1)

            return fib(num, arr);                                       >>> O(N)
        }else{
            return arr;
        }
    }
    O(1) + O(1) + O(1) + O(1) + O(1) + O(1) + O(N) ->
    6(O(1)) + O(N) -> >>> in Big O we look at the 'biggest term' which would be O(N) here
    O(N)

    This takes a constant amount of time and requires the constant amount of work N times - for computing additional sequence elements. So this has an O(N) runtime.

    The space needed would be O(S), the larger the requested length, the larger the array would be printed out.
